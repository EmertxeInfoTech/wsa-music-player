# WSA Music Player App

This project is a two-level music player application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It showcases an upgrade from a simple UI (Level 1) to a fully functional interactive player with play/pause and progress control (Level 2).

## 📁 Project Structure

WSA-Music-Player-App/  
├── level1/ --> Music Player UI  
├── level2/ --> Interactive Music Player  
└── README.md  

Each level contains its own `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files.  
Open the `index.html` file in either folder to preview the corresponding version of the app.
